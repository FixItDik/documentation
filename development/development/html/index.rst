HTML Coding Guidelines
======================

We use `HTMLHint <https://htmlhint.io/>`_ for checking the quality, linting, and ensuring consistent HTML code standards. There is a ``.htmlhintrc`` file in the root of the project, and your editor probably has a plugin available which will show you when you violate these standards.

We employ a set of standards based on the following widely used
`Idiomatic HTML Guidelines <https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-html/blob/master/README.md>`_

.. note:: Our editors of choice are `PhpStorm`_ & `ATOM`_ which provide useful plugins to make use of these tools. Check out the `Editor Setup`_ section of the docs for more information
