CSS Coding Guidelines
======================

We use `stylelint <https://stylelint.io/>`_ for checking the quality, linting, and ensuring consistent CSS code standards. There is a ``.stylelintrc`` file and a ``postcss-sorting.json`` file in the root of the project, and your editor probably has a plugin available which will show you when you violate these standards.

We employ a set of standards loosely based on the following widely used
`CSS Guidelines <http://cssguidelin.es/>`_

.. note:: Our editors of choice are `PhpStorm`_ & `ATOM`_ which provide useful plugins to make use of these tools. Check out the `Editor Setup`_ section of the docs for more information
